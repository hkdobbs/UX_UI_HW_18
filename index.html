    Hello - thanks for taking a look at my portfolio. 

I am fairly new to UX/UI Design and am eager to gain experience in the field. 

I graduated with a major in Communications from the College of Charleston and jumped into software sales following school.  I have since received a certificate in UX/UI Design from Denver University. 

My passion for user-centered design coupled with my major in communications, gives me a user first approach. 

I love learning about people and I love art. I approach design with the intent to merge the two. 

Outside of UX/UI design, I trail run incessantly, dabble in film photography, and love to read and write.
